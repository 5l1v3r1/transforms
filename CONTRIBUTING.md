# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/transforms.git

Set up your machine:

    ./script/bootstrap

Make sure the tests pass:

    ./script/test

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

    ./script/test

Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on me. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow the standard Python PEP8 standards.
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
